# RFM-Modeling-Python


### Background

RFM Model helps understand who are top-tiered customers and who arenâ€™t. The framework can help categorize data.

Moreover, recency, frequency, and monetary value is a marketing analysis tools used to identify a company's or organization's best customers by using certain measures.

### Overview

Here I try to get how recently a customer made an order from the company, how frequently they make an order from the company, and how much they spend when they become our customer. Metrics are generally on a scale of 1 to 5 (the higher the number, the better the result). The "best" customer would receive a top score in every category.

Last, each customer will be assigned to a particular marketing action and further apply clustering analysis to see if we miss any purchase behavior in our customers.
