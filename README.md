# RFM-Modeling-Python


RFM Model helps understand who are top-tiered customers and who arenâ€™t. The framework can help categorize data.

Recency, frequency, monetary value is a marketing analysis tool used to identify a company's or organization's best cutomers by using certain measuers. Here I try to get how recently a customer makes an order from the company, how frequently they make an order from the company, and how much they spend when they become our customer. Metrics are generally on a scale of 1 to 5 (the higher the number, the better the result). The "best" customer would receive a top score in every category.
